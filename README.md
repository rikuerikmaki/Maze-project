# Maze-project

Run the maze.py!



A program that creates a random n * n maze with a solution path. After creating the maze the program solves the maze with Depth-First-Search algorithm from any starting point to any ending point. In addition to visual features, the program returns the solution path coordinates. If there is no solution, it returns an empty list.
